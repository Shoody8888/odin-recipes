    <p>Kopytka or dumplings made of boiled and mashed potatoes, flour and eggs.</p>
    <p><ul>
        <li>1 kg of potatoes</li>
        <li>200 grams of flour</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
    </ul></p>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel the potatoes and boil them in salted water. Drain and immediately mash with a press to a perfectly smooth puree. Transfer to a bowl and cool completely.</li>
            <li>Add flour, egg and a pinch of salt. Combine the ingredients into a uniform dough.</li>
            <li>Put it on a table sprinkled with flour and divide it into 6 parts. Roll each piece into a thumb-thick roll by rolling it in flour.</li>
            <li>Slightly flatten the roller and cut with a knife into pieces about 1.5 - 2 cm wide.</li>
            <li>Cook in batches: place in boiling salted water in a large pot and cook for about 3 minutes from the time they float to the surface or until tender.</li>
            <li>During cooking, gently stir the water with a wooden spoon, checking if the dumplings did not stick to the bottom. Remove with a slotted spoon and place on plates.</li>
        </ol>
